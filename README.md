# unnamed_Brewhouse
repository for building brewhouse controller and automation software

#This repository will be where I author the software that controls my brew automation system using python 3.  I am currently just #learning the python 3 language.
#I am very new to coding, and expect there will be many errors, but this is also a learning experience for me and I expect many issues.
#Any advice, or direction those of you who stumble across this are willing to share please do, I appreciate the wisdom of those more #skilled.
#I will be using a Rasperry Pi 3 platform, two ten gallon coolers, one fifteen gallon pot, one propane burner, and two pumps initially.  #When I have more resources I will likely convert this sytem over to a RIMS or HERMS system based on my confidence in writing the #software to controll the system reliably and the overall cost of retrofitting.
