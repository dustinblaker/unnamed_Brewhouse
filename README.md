# unnamed_Brewhouse
repository for building brewhouse controller and automation software
#Much of the code in the GUIBrew.py file was taken from a tutorial done by Sentdex@ http://www.youtube.com/users/sentdex  I like the clean look and feel of his code in this tutorial and will try to adapt it to suit my needs, my current additions have broken the code.   I am close to a tipping point with python, where I can look at the code and visualize the outcome, when I reach that point I anticipate this becomoming much easier :).
#This repository will be where I author the software that controls my brew automation system using python 3.  I am currently just learning the python 3 language.
#I am very new to coding, and expect there will be many errors, but this is also a learning experience for me and I expect many issues.
#Any advice, or direction those of you who stumble across this are willing to share please do, I appreciate the wisdom of those more skilled.
#I will be using a Rasperry Pi 3 platform, two ten gallon coolers, one fifteen gallon pot, one propane burner, and two pumps initially.  When I have more resources I will likely convert this sytem over to a RIMS or HERMS system based on my confidence in writing the software to controll the system reliably and the overall cost of retrofitting.
